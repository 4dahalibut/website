Hi, My name is Josh Preuss.

I'm a fourth year Computer Engineering student at the University of Maryland -- College Park, and I have been interested in programming language theory, signal analysis, networking, and WiFi stuff. This is where I'll put all my ideas, once I have any, and while I'll try to keep it mostly professional, my personality is hard to hold down, so there shall be some wonkiness in the posts. Feel free to email me about your life problems at my email `josh (at) enjoysailing (dot) us`, or friend me on [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/josh.preusss). My github is [4dahalibut](https://github.com/4dahalibut) although there's not much there at this point. Happy surfing!
