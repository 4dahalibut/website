          <h1> Things I learned from my Internship</h1>
          <h4>About Myself</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>I work much harder when I feel like there's work I should be doing, that I know how to start on, and that improves something I care about</li>
            <li>Starting things is hard</li>
            <li>I can work all day effectively, if the work isn't super brain-intensive.  </li>
            <li>I like making cleanliness and ease of understanding a perogative</li>
            <li>I'm good but fairly slow at programming. </li>
            <li>I'm slow when I don't stay cognizant on what I'm trying to accomplish, and the steps I'm taking to get there.</li>
            <li>I'm slow to make up my mind</li>
            <li>I need to work on creating a decisive, cleaned-up front to approach business with</li>
            <li>My memory is pretty crap, I think I remember most things for like 2 weeks. so I should write things down when I learn them. </li>
          </ul>
          <h4>About software</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Code should be structured towards functional clarity first, but testability also. </li>
            <li>Testability comes with modularization, you should be able to run a part of your code separately from the rest</li>
            <li>Both unit tests and full-form tests are important, and should be developed incrementally</li>
            <li>Git is important for every project</li>
            <li>Good-looking code means uniform code</li>
            <li>Each unit and group of code should have a clear purpose, and this purpose should be reassessed as coding goes on</li>
            <li>Infrastructure can be more difficult than programming</li>
            <li>It is important to work on difficult problems, not just on whatever</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>About people</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>People are fickle and don't care about you</li>
            <li>Provide value to people, or make them think you are/will provide value</li>
          </ul>
