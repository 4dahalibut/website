          <h1>A random list of guys who put ideas on the internet</h1>
          <h4>Nadim Kobeissi: <a href="https://nadim.computer">https://nadim.computer</a></h4>
          <p>Nadim is born in my decade, the 90's. He is currently working on a PhD in cybersecurity, which is cool. He is very into ethical hacking, which is very cool, and, the FBI tried to entrap him for being vocal about his opinions, which made him just shout them louder. He doesn't blog too much though or about general issues.  </p>
          <h4>Moxie Marlinspike: <a href="https://moxie.org">https://moxie.org</a></h4>
          <p>Not his real name unfortunately, Moxie is the author of the Signal app, and is kind of a hippie dude. He upcycled a derelict ship in <a href="https://vimeo.com/15351476">this video</a> and has a good argument about why you should avoid supporting structures in life <a href="https://moxie.org/blog/career-advice/">right over here</a></p>
          <h4>Dan Luu: <a href="http://danluu.com">http://danluu.com</a></h4>
          <p>Hardware hacker turned software hacker, this fairly "normal guy" churns out an amazing amount of knowledge.</p>
          <h4>Jamie Brandon: <a href="http://scattered-thoughts.net">http://scattered-thoughts.net</a></h4>
          <p>Approaching the fakeish "uberhacker" mentality of some bloggers who I'm not a fan of, Brandon has a penchant for attaching drive and rationalism to all his thoughts. Motif of "feral man-ape" which means that he is happiest without schedule and is most productive when nobody is forcing him to work. Would rather make something people want than have people want him to make something.  </p>
          <h4>Aaron Swartz: <a href="http://www.aaronsw.com">http://www.aaronsw.com</a></h4>
          <p>If I had one hero it would probably be Aaron. Super passionate and smart from a young age, he blogged his path from a kid to being one of the leaders of the modern ethical hacker movement. Wonderful blog, especially the raw nerve series. </p>
          <h4>Hans Moravec: <a href="http://www.frc.ri.cmu.edu/~hpm/project.archive">http://www.frc.ri.cmu.edu/~hpm/project.archive/</a></h4>
          <p>I was linked to an article Hans wrote from Greg Egan's blog. He's a famous roboticist and futurologist, and has a lot to say about the singularity and being and existence and all that shit. Definitely need to read more Hans tho. I just discovered his work.   </p>
          <h4>Greg Egan: <a href="http://gregegan.customer.netspace.net.au">http://gregegan.customer.netspace.net.au</a></h4>
          <p>In a rare league when it comes to putting the science in hard science fiction, Egan is A) Singular in what he does, as he doesnt participate with the rest of society, and B) Creates "fully" scientific worlds for his novels. He puts more reasonable ideas per page in his books than most authors do over the course of their entire book. If you want to have your mind blown, read Egan. His blog also features mathematical simulations of various cool patterns he's made up over the
          years. Very fun to play with, but they're all written to use the Java applet, which unfortunately (thankafully) not too many people have anymore. </p>
          <h4>Lucas Veira Barbosa: <a href="http://1ucasvb.tumblr.com">http://1ucasvb.tumblr.com</a></h4>
          <p>Draws pretty math gif pictures</p>
          <h4>Primitive Technology: <a href="https://primitivetechnology.wordpress.com">https://primitivetechnology.wordpress.com</a></h4>
          <p>Builds really nice looking stuff from absolute scratch.</p>
          <h4>Jamie Mantzel: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/JMEMantzel">https://www.youtube.com/user/JMEMantzel/featured</a></h4>
          <p>Built a giant robot spider, built a house in the middle of nowhere on the cheap, moved to the tropics, lives on an island, built a boat, has kids, has a beautiful wife, lives the dream</p>
